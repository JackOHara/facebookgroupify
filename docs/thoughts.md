- Store Spotify ID that matches Youtube title in DynamoDB to reduce Spotify API calls (if we find we are calling Spotify too often).
- Delete feed nodes as we scroll fb so we can reduce memory required and scrape for longer.
- to get soundcloud metadata simply load the page and it is in the title
- use commit hash for deployment rollbacks for handiness
- eslint on PR



cdk deploy
