## The Future
I have two goals I'd like to achieve in this project.

### Allow end users to use this
The every day user who wants to see music from a Facebook group they use go to a Spotify playlist should be able to do this without needing to deploy this application and modify code. Doing this might entail some kind of UI that allows users to submit a Facebook group.

### Enable other developers to contribute
As this project initially started out as a bit of a hack some of the documentation and code quality is lacking to say the least. I would like to improve both the docs and testing around existing code so other developers can easily run the app and make changes to it with confidence it won't lead to regressions. 

## Todo
The [roadmap](./roadmap) folder contains files documenting work that should be done. When an item is complete files should be renamed to the pattern ```DONE-{change-name}.md```.
