A user could acccess the app via a user interface. Submit a group ID and the app would create a playlist and set up a scheduled job to scrape the playlist. 

Music groups are often private so we would need to be able to request access to join (assuming we are reusing my FB credentials which I'd rather not but it looks like there is no other choice).

It would be great if we could have them third party sign in through Spotify and allow them to add songs to their own playlists. This would also reduce scalability concerns with the Spotify API as it rate limits somewhere between 10-20 rps per user. The app currently is reusing my own Spotify credentials.
