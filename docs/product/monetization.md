## Money
When I created this I did not consider money at all. Currently the running costs are about £5 a month but that will be reduced greatly in upcoming changes. Only two playlists are running so £2.50 a playlist.

While washing dishes I had a thought. I could add a mates song to these playlist full of genuine user content and they would get plays. Is it wrong to do this? 

Then I had a google. It turns out there is a massive industry around people curating playlists and charging to have a song added or charging for simply considering adding it to a playlist. Some of these sites had a requirement of X amount of followers on a playlist. I posted one of the playlists in a music group of 1.7k people two days ago and got 72 followers on it. What if I posted it in many groups? Build up an eventual following. Occasionally promote the playlist in the groups. 

Then I could use one of these services. Maybe I could just sell the app to someone already in this business. Make a quick buck or two. 

### Actions
- Implement cost saving features
- Calculate exact cost per playlist
- Soundcloud / bandcamp integrations would be great.
- Gain greater understanding of how much money I could make with x followers - how it works as a curator
- Join some FB groups. Start scraping. Consider my approach so I can gain as many followers as possible
    * How do you discover groups, do you need to gain their trust as well.
