## Song Matching
The current song matching algorithmn was developed hastily. 
We should experiment with the matching to see if we can improve the accuracy of matching and also increase the number of songs matched. 

We have collected a lot of clean data from scraped Facebook groups and can retrigger them through the pipeline if we improve the matching strategy. This will provide the end user with more songs in their playlists.
