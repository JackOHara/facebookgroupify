## Todo
- CDK deploy
- Docs
- Restructure node apps
## Possible Future Improvements (in no particular order)
- Store Spotify ID that matches Youtube title in DynamoDB to reduce Spotify API calls (if we find we are calling Spotify too often).
- Add metadata to logger after it has been created. (Will need to singleton logger)
- X-Ray tracing through system
